    "text": "5. Identifiability and simulation tests\n\nA. What would perfect prediction would look like under the 7–3 stop rule?\nBefore discussing any fitted model, it is useful to ask: If we actually knew the truth how good would our predictions about the deck be? Assume we know, for each deck, its true match win probability ( p ) and precisely how the underlying components contribute to it. Even in this “oracle” setting, a draft tournament run does not show us ( p ) directly. Instead, each deck is run through a truncated tournament where the run is stopped after accumulating either 7 wins or 3 losses. We can observe only the final record and from that compute an empirical win-rate for the deck and we can approximate the skill level of the player piloting the deck. This stopping rule injects noise. A perfect predictive model cannot remove this noise; it can only sit underneath it. Then the key question of interest is given these limitations on observations is how close to truth about net deck effect and bump can we get?\nTo study this, I built a generative simulator that creates a synthetic draft ecosystem with full control over the “true” underlying quantities. The simulator is intentionally simple, only five cards exist but it captures the essential causal structure. Each simulated player has a latent skill value which determines their baseline win probability \\(p\\). The player’s underlying skill influences which cards the player adds to their decks, real players don’t pick cards at random and vary in their abilities to assess the quality of cards. Each card has an intrinsic likelihood of being selected and the probability of selection is modified by the player’s skill. High skill players will select win-rate increasing cards more often than low skill players. This allows the simulation to inject confounding of the type \\(P\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(D\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(W\\), \\(P\\) \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(W\\) that we see in real draft data.\nThe deck composition then produces a true deck effect. Once the draft is simulated the deck’s composition is run through a structural function that generates a true “deck bump”, this can be interpreted as a modifier to the player’s baseline win probability. This function considers the individual card strengths, interactions and anti-synergies between subsets of cards, skill-dependent effects (e.g. some complicated card may be misplayed frequently by low skill players), and an upper bound on how much a deck can add or subtract from the baseline skill. These elements produce the true deck effect \\(\\Delta p_{deck}\\) .\nThe baseline skill and the true deck effect combine to create the true match win-rate probability: \\(p_{true} = logistic(skill) + \\Delta p_{deck}\\)\nIn a real draft this value would be invisible.\nNext, the Magic Arena 7W - 3L best-of-one tournament logic is applied. Each deck is run through the same truncated process that characterizes the Premier Draft structure. At each stage of the tournament the outcome of the match is determined by \\(p_{true}\\) and stopped when either 7 wins are reached or 3 losses. A simplifying assumption i make is that \\(p_{true}\\) is constant throughout the run, in reality this is not the case due to Arena’s underlying matchmaking algorithm. This process produces an observed win rate, what we would see in practice when analyzing real draft data. Our observed deck bump would then be:\n\\(\\Delta p_{obs} = \\hat p_{MLE} - p_{baseline}\\)\nNow that we know the ground truth we can ask “How well does a model recover the true deck effect when using what is observable?”, “What is the best possible \\(R^2\\) any model could ever hope to achieve?” , “How much does the stopping rule distort the relationship between \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\) and \\(\\Delta p_{obs}\\)?”. “What fraction of the variance is irreducible noise?”. These quantities define the upper bound on model performance.\n\n\nFindings\nTo answer the question “How well can a model recover the true deck bump effect when it only has access to observable data?”, I generate a training and test set of 20,000 simulated decks. Each deck has a known underlying win-probability bump \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\) but the model sees only what would be available in real draft data: deck composition, player’s baseline win-rate (a proxy for skill), and the final 7-3 run record. From these it can form the observed bump \\(\\Delta p_{obs} = p_{MLE} - p_{base}\\) , which is a noisy quantity that we would normally try to learn from.\nI train an XGBoost model to predict \\(\\Delta p_{obs}\\) from deck composition and player skill, then evaluate predictions on the held-out test set by comparing \\(\\Delta p_{pred}\\) against the ground truth \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\). Under these conditions the model performs extremely well. The regression of \\(\\Delta p_{pred}\\) on \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\) is tightly concentrated around the identity line (Figure 1) demonstrating that the model successfully learned the true deck effect from \\(\\Delta p_{obs}\\).\nThis result reveals an important result: The modeling strategy is capable of capturing the causal contribution of deck contribution to win probability \\((D \\rightarrow W)\\) when the signal is available.\n\n\n Figure 1. XGBoost achieves high fidelity recovery of the true deck effect Δp under full observability.\nFigure 1: ?(caption)\n\n\nCrucially, this near-perfect recovery is unobservable in real data because Δpₜᵣᵤₑ is never seen. The only outcome we observe is the result of the truncated 7-3 Arena record, which is a very noisy proxy for deck strength. This leads to the second question: What is the best possible \\(R^2\\) that any model could hope to achieve?\nTo answer this I simulate an idealized scenario where the true deck win probability \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\) is known exactly. I repeatedly run each deck through the 7-3 stopping rule to generate the corresponding observed deck bump \\(\\Delta p_{obs} = p_{MLE} - p_{base}\\) . I then fit the best possible linear model \\(\\Delta p_{obs} \\sim \\Delta p_{true}\\) allowing both the intercept and slope to be estimated freely. This regression represents the maximum recoverable signal contained in the observable outcome.\nEven with perfect knoweldge of the underlying win-rate, the best achievable \\(R^2\\) is only about .06 (Figure 2). This seemingly low value is due to the intrinsic variance injected by the 7-3 tournament structure. The early stopping rule overwhelms the true effect with noise leaving only a small fraction identifiable from the observable results.\n\n Figure 2. Identifiability limit imposed by the Arena 7-3 stopping rule.\nEach point represents a simulated deck with known true win-rate bump \\(\\Delta p_{true}\\) and the corresponding observed bump \\(\\Delta p_{obs}\\) obtained after running the deck through a tournament. The solid line is the slope of the best fitting linear regression model. The dashed line indicates the identity. With perfect knowledge the maximum achievable \\(R^2\\) is about .06. This reflects the intrinsic variance introduced by the tournament structure."

    "text": "8. discussion\nthe broader contribution is methodological: deck construction is a reproducible sandbox for causal inference with:\n\nhigh-dimensional treatments \\(D\\),\n\nstructured confounding via \\(P\\),\n\nlarge sample sizes,\n\nquasi-random assignment noise from packs.\n\nthis same causal template appears in biological data:\n\n\\(P\\) = genomic background or copy number,\n\n\\(D\\) = high-dimensional gene expression,\n\n\\(W\\) = drug response.\n\nthe deck-bump estimator parallels expression-mediated effect isolation.\n\nRecovery of the Deck Effect under Realistic Observation Noise\nAlthough the estimand defined in 2.3 is model agnostic, its recoverability in practice depends on the information constraints imposed by the Arena tournament structure. In particular, the latent per-game win probability \\(p(D,P)\\) is never directly observed. Instead we observe only a stopped 7-3 fun outcome, which induces substantial variance and bias in any estimator derived from realized wins and losses. This censoring mechanism imposes a fundamental noise floor on inference that no modeling choice can eliminate.\nTo assess the practical limitations of these constraints, I constructed a simulated environment consistent with the assumed DAG, in which the true deck effect and baseline player skill are known, but only noisy proxies which mirror the real Arena data, are observed. This allows us to separate limitations due to statistical identifiability from those imposed by the observation process itself.\n\n\nXGBoost as a Function Approximator for the G-Formula\nWithin the simulated environment, I use XGBoost as a flexible function approximator to learn the mapping implied by the g-formula:\n\\((D,P) \\rightarrow E[W | D,P]\\)\nand, by extension, the skill-adjusted deck effect. XGBoost is not essential to the estimand itself; instead it serves as a practical stand-in for a broad class of nonlinear models capable of capturing interactions nd saturation effects in high-dimensional deck representations.\nThe role of the model in this context is not to introduce causal structure, but to approximate a conditional expectation that s already causally identified by adjustment for player skill. Any sufficiently expressive learner with adequate regularization could, in principle, serve the same purpose.\n\n\nPerformance relative to the noise ceiling\nA key result of the simulation is that XGBoost achieves predictive performance on the observed win-rate bump that approaches the theoretical ceiling implied by the 7-3 stopping rule. That is, accuracy is close to what would be attainable even if the true latent deck effect were known exactly and only the noisy outcome remained.\nThis finding is important for interpretation. Remaining errors should not be attributed to model inadequacy, but rather to irreducible uncertainty introduced by tournament censoring and finite sample sizes. In this sense, the model’s performance provides an empirical upper bound on how well the deck estimand can be recovered from Arena style data.\n\n\nImplications for Real World Arena Data\nBecause the true deck effect is unobservable in real data, simulation serves as the only setting in which recovery can be directly validated. The results suggest that under realistic conditions, a substantial fraction of the causal signal attributable to deck composition can be recovered. This has two implications. First, improvements in model architecture alone are unlikely to yield large gains beyond this point. Second, alternative data sources or experimental design would be required to meaningfully reduce uncertainty around deck effects.\n\n\nScope and Intended Use of the Estimator\nFinally, it is important to emphasize the scope of the resulting estimator. The model targets the causal contribution of the final realized deck composition, holding player skill fixed. While this quantity can be used as a heuristic signal during a live draft, it is not optimized for decision-making under partial information. Live draft guidance is better framed as a sequential decision problem, where the relevant object is the expected downstream value of an action given the evolving draft state, rather than the value of the terminal deck alone."
