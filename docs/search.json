    "text": "1. introduction\npredictive models for limited formats (e.g., xgboost, neural networks) estimate how good a deck will perform. they do not isolate why. in games like magic: the gathering, draft decisions couple tightly to player skill: stronger players select higher-value cards, commit earlier, navigate signals better, and construct smoother curves. this creates a persistent confounding problem:\n\ndeck composition D correlates with skill P,\n\nP also causes better win results W,\n\nso naïve models inflate the apparent value of cards favored by strong players.\n\ni treat the draft ecosystem as a high-dimensional causal inference problem. the goal is to estimate\nE[W | do(D)]\nrather than E[W | D], i.e., isolate the effect of deck construction itself."
